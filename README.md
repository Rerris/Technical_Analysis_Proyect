-This code first uses functions that create the parameter for the indicators: RSI, MACD, EMA 200, EMA 13 and EMA 48.

-Then it creates combinations of these indicators and indentifies which one maximizes profit.

-With this combination that maximizes profit it finds the optimized parameters for the combinaton of indicators.

-then we create models of Machine Learning to obtain results 

-optimized and backtest the models.

-Finally we get the profit using this strategy.
