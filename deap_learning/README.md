-This code creates a neuronal network where it is trained with the amount of previous days that are desired.

-It uses the train data with a split of train and test

-It uses keras to create 2 LSTM layers

-This code uses early stopping to eliminate unuseful epochs, it has a hyperparameter of 10 

-Then the model is saved

-After this it imports the test data 

-Afterwards it predicts the values of X and compares it with the actual test data

-Then the model is tested on the backtesting process that is optimized 

-Finally it creates the value of the portfolio throught time
